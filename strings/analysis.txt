Sentence boundary detection: The following punctuation marks are considered as
potential sentence boundaries: period, exclamation point, question mark, ellipsis. A
set of automatically acquired disambiguation rules (Stamatatos et al. 1999) is, then,
applied to every potential sentence boundary in order to locate the actual sentence
boundaries. These rules utilize neither lexicons with specialized information nor
abbreviation lists.
Token-level: The sample text is considered as a set of tokens grouped in sentences.
This level is based on the output of the sentence boundary detector:
Sentence Boundary
Detection

Morphological Descriptions
Multiple-pass Parsing





1. M01 detected sentences / words1
2. M02 punctuation marks / words
3. M03 detected sentences / potential sentence boundaries

Phrase-level: The sample text is considered as a set of phrases (i.e., chunks). This
level is based on the output of the chunk boundary detector:
Code Description

1. M04 detected NPs / total detected chunks
2. M05 detected VPs / total detected chunks
3. M06 detected APs / total detected chunks
4. M07 detected PPs / total detected chunks
5. M08 detected CONs / total detected chunks
6. M09 words included in NPs / detected NPs
7. M10 words included in VPs / detected VPs
8. M11 words included in APs / detected APs
9. M12 words included in PPs / detected PPs
10. M13 words included in CONs / detected CONs

 Analysis-level: It includes measures that represent the way in which the sample text
has been analyzed by the particular methodology of the SCBD:
Code Description

11. M14 detected keywords / words
12. M15 special words / words
13, M16 assigned morphological descriptions / words
14. M17 chunks’ morphological descriptions / total detected chunks
15. M18 words remaining unanalyzed after pass 1 / words
16. M19 words remaining unanalyzed after pass 2 / words
17. M20 words remaining unanalyzed after pass 3 / words
18. M21 words remaining unanalyzed after pass 4 / words
19. M22 words remaining unanalyzed after pass 5 / words
