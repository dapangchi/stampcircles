'''Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz''' (born [[August 13]], [[1926]]) has been [[Cuba]]'s leader since 1959. He came to power in an armed [[Cuban revolution|revolution]] that overthrew the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]], and was shortly thereafter sworn in as the [[Prime Minister of Cuba|Prime Minister]] of [[Cuba]].<ref name="Castro sworn in as Cuban PM">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/16/newsid_2544000/2544431.stm |title=1959: Castro sworn in as Cuban PM |publisher= BBC News |accessdate=2006-06-06 }}</ref> In 1965 he became First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] and led the transformation of Cuba into a [[one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]].

==Abstract==

Castro first attracted attention in Cuban political life through [[nationalism|nationalist]] critiques of Batista and the [[United States]] political and corporate influence in Cuba. He gained an ardent, but limited, following and also drew the attention of the authorities.<ref>{{cite book | last =DePalma | first =Anthony | year = 2006 | month = | url = | title =The Man Who Invented Fidel | publisher =Public Affairs}}</ref> He eventually led the failed 1953 attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]], after which he was captured, tried, incarcerated and later released. He then travelled to Mexico<ref name="The Spirit Of Moncada">{{cite web | last =Bockman | first =Larry James | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 1984 | month =April 1 | url =http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/BLJ.htm | title =The Spirit Of Moncada: Fidel Castro's Rise To Power, 1953 - 1959 | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = | language = | accessdate =2006-06-13 }}</ref><ref name="Sweig">{{cite book |first=Julia E. |last=Sweig |year=2002 | title=Inside the Cuban Revolution |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-00848-0}}</ref> to organize and train for the [[guerrilla]] invasion of Cuba that took place in December 1956.

Since his assumption of power in 1959 Castro has evoked both praise and condemnation (at home and internationally). Opponents characterize Castro as a [[dictator]], claiming that he has not risen to power through open, public elections, and some contend that his rule is illegitimate because the socialist system itself was not established through what they considered to be legal means.<ref>[http://www.juanperez.com/constitution/XIX.html]</ref> Supporters, on the other hand, see Castro as a charismatic leader<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 2006 | month = | url =http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0810800.html | title =Infoplease Almanac | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = NPR | language = | accessdate =2006-08-08}}</ref> whose presidential authority has been acquired through legitimate elections.<ref>[http://www.newhumanist.com/geiser.html]</ref>

Outside of Cuba, Castro has been defined by his relationship with the [[United States]] and the former [[Soviet Union]], both of whom courted Cuban attentions as part of their own global political agenda. While Cuba's relations with countries of the [[Eastern bloc|Soviet bloc]] were generally cordial during the [[Cold War]], the Castro-led government has had an antagonistic relationship with the United States since the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] of Cuba in 1961 by U.S.-backed forces.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Cuba's one major Latin American ally, Nicaragua, in the early 1990s, the Cuban government found itself in a precarious spot. However, in recent years, Castro has found new regional allies in Latin America. [[Latin America|Regional]] Socialist and nationalist figures such as [[Hugo Chávez]] in [[Venezuela]] and [[Evo Morales]] in [[Bolivia]] have been ready allies. Castro also holds currently the title of Secretary-General of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (his second term in that office, the first having been 1979-1983).

At home, Fidel Castro has overseen the implementation of various economic policies, leading to the rapid centralization of Cuba's economy, [[land reform]], [[collectivization]] and [[mechanization]] of agriculture, and the [[expropriation]] of leading [[Economy of Cuba|Cuban industries]]. Opponents claim that these changes have at best maintained Cuba's pre-1959 level of development, but at an "extraordinary" cost to the overall welfare of Cubans.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/p/wha/ci/14776.htm]</ref> Conversely, supporters attribute the U.S. embargo for some or all of Cuba's shortcomings, but maintain that Cuba's economy has expanded and grown at a more than acceptable rate since the revolution.

The expansion of [[Healthcare of Cuba|publicly funded health care]] and [[Education in Cuba|education]] has been a cornerstone of Castro's domestic political program. Cuba ranks better than many countries on the United Nations' [[list of countries by infant mortality rate]], which is claimed by Castro's supporters as a success of his government. Opponents claim that Cuba's health care and infant mortality were the same if not better before the revolution<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/cubaprecastro21698.html]</ref> and question the truthfulness of statistics concerning Cuba, despite its republication by the [[United Nations]], [[World Health Organization]], and [[Central Intelligence Agency]], due to the fact that most of this data is collected, or assisted in the collection, by the Cuban government.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Exclusiva/story?id=3568278 Healthy in Cuba, Sick in America?

==Childhood and education==
[[Image:FCR to FDR letter complete.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A letter written by the twelve-year-old Castro to U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], expressing admiration and asking for a $10 bill. Castro writes, "If you like, give me a ten dollar bill green American, because never, I have not seen a ten dollar bill," signing the letter, "Thank you very much. Good by [''sic'']. Your friend, Fidel Castro."]]

Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on a sugar plantation in [[Birán]], near [[Mayarí]], in the modern-day [[Holguín Province|province of Holguín]] – then a part of the now-defunct [[Oriente|Oriente province]]. He was the third child born to [[Ángel Castro y Argiz]], a [[Galician people|Galician]] immigrant who became relatively prosperous through work in the sugar industry and successful investing. His mother, Lina Ruz González, who was a household servant, was also of Galician background.<ref name="The Spirit Of Moncada" /> Angel Castro was married to another woman, Maria Luisa Argota,<ref name="Confidential"> Bardach, Ann Louise : Cuba Confidential. p57-59</ref> until Fidel was 17, and thus Fidel as a child had to deal both with his illegitimacy and the challenge of being raised in various foster homes away from his father's house.

Castro has two brothers: [[Ramón Castro (Cuban revolutionary)|Ramón]] and [[Raúl Castro|Raúl]], and four sisters: Angelita, [[Juanita Castro|Juanita]], Enma, and Agustina. All of them were born out of wedlock. He also has two half siblings, Lidia and Pedro Emilio who were raised by Ángel Castro's first wife.

Fidel was not baptized until he was eight, also very uncommon, bringing embarrassment and ridicule from other children.<ref name=Raffy>Raffy, Serge. 2004 Castro el Desleal. Santillana Ediciones Generales, S.L. Madrid. ISBN 84-03-09508-2</ref><ref name=Fuentes>Fuentes, Norberto 2005 La Autobiografia de Fidel Castro. Destino Ediciones. ISBN 970-749-001-2</ref> Ángel Castro finally dissolved his first marriage when Fidel was 15 and married Fidel’s mother. Castro was formally recognized by his father when he was 17, when his surname was legally changed to Castro from Ruz, his mother’s name.<ref name=Raffy/><ref name=Fuentes/>
Although accounts of his education differ, most sources agree that he was an intellectually gifted student, more interested in sports than in academics, and spent many years in private Catholic boarding schools, finishing high school at [[Belen Jesuit Preparatory School|El Colegio de Belén]], a [[Jesuit]] school in Havana in 1945.<ref name="From Student to Revolutionary">{{cite web | last = | first = |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.history.ca/content/ContentDetail.aspx?ContentId=41 | title = Fidel Castro: From Student to Revolutionary|work = [[History Television]]|publisher = [[Alliance Atlantis Communications]] Inc. | accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}</ref>

==Political beginnings==
In late 1945, Castro entered law school at the [[University of Havana]]. He became immediately embroiled in the political culture at the University, which was a reflection of the volatile politics in Cuba during that era.[[Image:R2247968516.jpg|thumb|right|250px|University student Fidel Castro (center, standing, in black suit) addressing fellow students during a protest on [[November 11]], [[1947]].]] Since the fall of president [[Gerardo Machado]] in the 1930s, student politics had degenerated into a form of ''gangsterismo'' dominated by fractious action groups, and Castro, believing that the gangs posed a physical threat to his university aspirations, experienced what he later described as "a great moment of decision."<ref name="Masferrer"/> He returned to the university from a brief hiatus to involve himself fully in the various violent battles and disputes which surrounded university elections, and was to be implicated in a number of shootings linked to [[Rolando Masferrer]]'s MSR action group. "To not return", said Castro later, "would be to give in to bullies, to abandon my beliefs".<ref name="Masferrer">[[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Thomas, Hugh]] : Cuba the Pursuit of Freedom p.523-524 </ref> Rivalries were so intense that Castro apparently collaborated in an attempt on Masferrer's life during this period,<ref name="Masferrer"/> while Masferrer, whose paramilitary group ''Les Tigres'' later became an instrument of state violence under Batista,<ref>{{wikiref |id=Sweig-2002 |text=Sweig, p.27}}</ref> perennially hunted the younger student seeking violent retribution.<ref>Bardach, Ann Louise : Cuba Confidential. p.40</ref>

In 1947, growing increasingly passionate about social justice, Castro joined the [[Partido Ortodoxo]] which had been newly formed by [[Eduardo Chibás]]. A charismatic and emotional figure, Chibás was running for president against the incumbent [[Ramón Grau San Martín]] who had allowed rampant corruption to flourish during his term. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} The Partido Ortodoxo publicly exposed corruption and demanded government and social reform. It aimed to instill a strong sense of national identity among Cubans, establish Cuban economic independence and freedom from the United States, and dismantle the power of the elite over Cuban politics. Though Chibás lost the election, Castro, considering Chibás his mentor, remained committed to his cause, working fervently on his behalf. In 1951, while running for president again, Chibás shot himself in the stomach during a radio broadcast. Castro was present and accompanied him to the hospital where he died.<ref name="From Student to Revolutionary" />

===Bogotazo===
{{Main article|Bogotazo}}
{{context}}
Fidel Castro's role in the Bogotazo incident has been dogged by speculation and controversy but the following account seems to be generally agreed upon. In 1948 Castro traveled to [[Bogotá]] in [[Colombia]] for a political conference of Latin American students that coincided with the ninth meeting of the [[Pan-American Union]] Conference. The students had planned to use this opportunity to distribute pamphlets protesting United States dominance of the Western Hemisphere and to foment discontent. A few days after the conference began, the populist [[Colombian Liberal Party]] leader [[Jorge Eliecer Gaitán]] was assassinated, triggering massive riots in the streets in which many (mostly poor workers) were injured or killed. Rioting and looting spread to other cities in Colombia, beginning an era of turbulence that became known as "[[La Violencia]]". The students were caught up in the violence and chaos rocking the city, picking up rifles and roaming the streets distributing anti-United States material and stirring a revolt. When Castro was pursued by the Colombian authorities for his role in the riots, he took refuge in the Cuban Embassy and was flown back to Havana.<ref>{{cite web | last = Castro | first = Fidel|date= [[1982-04-11]] | url = http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/castro/1982/19820411 | title = Fidel Castro reveals role in 9 April 1948 Colombian uprising | work = Bogota el Siglo | publisher = | accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Suchlicki | first = James |date=February 2003 | url = http://www.cubacenter.org/media/news_articles/fidel_us.php3 | title = Fidel Castro on the United States - Forward | work = | publisher = Center for a Free Cuba | accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}</ref> It seems clear that experiencing the power of popular insurrection had an effect on Castro and influenced his subsequent political thinking.

Castro returned to Cuba and married [[Mirta Diaz-Balart|Mirta Díaz Balart]], a student from a wealthy Cuban family where he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite. In 1950 he graduated from law school with a Doctor of Laws degree and began practicing law in a small partnership in Havana, mostly representing the poor and underprivileged. By now he had become well known for his passionately [[nationalism|nationalist]]ic views and his intense opposition to the influence of the United States on Cuban internal affairs. Increasingly interested in a career in politics, Castro had become a candidate for a seat in the Cuban [[parliament]] when General [[Fulgencio Batista]] led a [[coup d'état]] in 1952, successfully overthrowing the government of President [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]] and canceling the election.

Batista established himself as [[de facto]] leader with the support of establishment elements of Cuban society and powerful Cuban agencies. His government was formally recognized by the United States, buttressing his power. Castro, nearing thirty, was now a politician without a legitimate platform and thus he broke away from the Partido Ortodoxo to marshal legal arguments based on the Constitution of 1940 to formally charge Batista with violating the [[constitution]]. His petition, entitled ''Zarpazo'', was denied by the Court of Constitutional Guarantees and he was not allowed a hearing.<ref> Hugh Thomas. ''Cuba : The Pursuit of Freedom'' p532.</ref>
This experience formed the foundation for Castro's opposition to the Batista government and convinced him that revolution was the only way to depose Batista.<ref> {{cite book | first= Jules | last= Duboise | authorlink= | coauthors= | year= 1959 | title= Fidel Castro: Rebel-Liberator or Dictator? | edition= | publisher= Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc | location= Indianapolis | id= }} </ref>

==Cuban Revolution==
{{main|Cuban revolution}}
===Attack on Moncada Barracks===
{{main|Moncada Barracks}}
As discontent over the Batista coup grew, Castro abandoned his law practice and formed an underground organization of supporters, including his brother, [[Raúl Castro|Raúl]], and [[Mario Chanes de Armas]]. Together they actively plotted to overthrow Batista. They collected guns and ammunition and finalized their plans for an armed attack on [[Moncada Barracks]], Batista's largest garrison outside [[Santiago de Cuba]]. On the 26th of July, 1953, they attacked [[Moncada Barracks]]. The Céspedes garrison in Bayamo was also attacked as a diversion.<ref name="The Spirit Of Moncada" /> The attack proved disastrous and more than sixty of the one-hundred and thirty-five [[militant]]s involved were killed.

Castro and other surviving members of his group managed to escape to a part of the rugged [[Sierra Maestra]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Sierra | first = J. A. | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/funfacts/maestra.htm | title = The Sierra Maestra | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = historyofcuba.com | language =|accessdate = 2006-05-19|accessyear = }} </ref> mountains east of Santiago where they were eventually discovered and captured. Although there is disagreement over why Castro and his brother, [[Raúl Castro|Raúl]], were not executed on capture as many of their fellow militants were, there is evidence that an officer recognized Castro from his university days and treated the captured rebels compassionately, despite the 'illegal' unofficial order to have the leader executed.<ref name="The Spirit Of Moncada" /> Others, such as Angel Prado, military commander of the 26th of July Movement, say that on the night of the attack Castro's driver got lost and he never reached the barracks. That night was the night of “El Carnaval de Santiago” and the streets of Santiago de Cuba were filled with party goers.

Castro was tried in the fall of 1953 and sentenced to up to fifteen years in prison.<ref>{{cite web |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.biologydaily.com/biology/Fidel_Castro#Cuban_Missile_Crisis | title = Fidel Castro | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = Biological Daily | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-06}}</ref> During his trial Castro delivered his famous defense speech ''[[History Will Absolve Me]]'',<ref name="History Will Absolve Me">{{cite web | last = Tabío | first = Pedro Álvarez |date= 1975 | year = | month = | url = http://www.marxists.org/history/cuba/archive/castro/1953/10/16.htm | title = History Will Absolve Me | work = | publisher = Editorial de Ciencias Sociales, La Habana, Cuba | accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}</ref> upholding his rebellious actions and boldly declaring his political views:

{{cquote|I warn you, I am just beginning! If there is in your hearts a vestige of love for your country, love for humanity, love for justice, listen carefully... I know that the [[regime]] will try to suppress the truth by all possible means; I know that there will be a conspiracy to bury me in oblivion. But my voice will not be stifled – it will rise from my breast even when I feel most alone, and my heart will give it all the fire that callous cowards deny it... Condemn me. It does not matter. History will absolve me.}}

While he was being held at the prison for political activists on [[Isla de la Juventud|Isla de Pinos]], he continued to plot Batista's overthrow, planning upon release to reorganize and train in Mexico.<ref name="The Spirit Of Moncada" /> After having served less than two years, he was released in May 1955 due to a general [[amnesty]] from Batista who was under political pressure, and went as planned to [[Mexico]].<ref name="Sweig"/>

===26th of July Movement===
{{main|26th of July Movement}}
Once in Mexico, Castro reunited with other Cuban exiles and founded the [[26th of July Movement]], named after the date of the failed attack on the Moncada Barracks. The goal remained the overthrow of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Castro had learned from the Moncada experience that new tactics were needed if Batista's forces were to be defeated. This time, the plan was to use underground guerrilla tactics, at that time a form of combat unknown in Latin America.<ref name="The Spirit Of Moncada" />

In Mexico Castro met [[Che Guevara|Ernesto "Che" Guevara]], a proponent of [[guerrilla warfare]]. Guevara joined the group of rebels and became an important force in shaping Castro's evolving political beliefs. Guevara's observations of the misery of the poor in Latin America had already convinced him that the only solution lay in violent revolution.

Since regular contacts with a KGB agent named [[Nikolai Leonov|Nikolai Sergeevich Leonov]] in [[Mexico City]] had not resulted in the hoped for weapon supply,<ref name="Andrew"/> they decided to go to the [[United States]] to gather personnel and funds from Cubans living there, including [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]], the elected Cuban president deposed by Batista in 1952. Back in Mexico, the group trained under a [[Spanish Civil War]] Veteran, Cuban-born [[Alberto Bayo]]<ref name="History Will Absolve Me" /> who had fled to Mexico after [[Francisco Franco]]'s victory in [[Spain]]. On [[November 26]] [[1956]], Castro and his group of 81 followers, mostly Cuban exiles, set out from [[Tuxpan]], [[Veracruz]], aboard the yacht ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]].'' for the purpose of starting a rebellion in Cuba.<ref name="The Landing of the Granma">{{cite web | last = Sierra | first = J. A. | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/granma.htm | title = The Landing of the Granma | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = historyofcuba.com | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-15}}</ref>

The rebels landed at Playa Las Coloradas close to [[Los Cayuelos]] near the eastern city of [[Manzanillo, Cuba|Manzanillo]] on [[December 2]], [[1956]]. In short order, most of Castro's men were killed, dispersed, or taken prisoner by Batista's forces.<ref name="The Landing of the Granma" /> While the exact number is in dispute, it is agreed that no more than twenty of the original eighty-two men survived the bloody encounters with the Cuban army and succeeded in fleeing to the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains.<ref>{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Hugh | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = Cuba or The Pursuit of Freedom (Updated Edition) | publisher = Da Capo Press|location = New York|id = ISBN 0-306-80827-7}}</ref> The group of survivors included Fidel Castro, [[Che Guevara]], [[Raúl Castro]], and [[Camilo Cienfuegos]]. Those who survived were aided by people in the countryside. They regrouped in the [[Sierra Maestra]] in Oriente province and organized a column under Fidel Castro's command.

From their [[military camp|encampment]] in the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains, the 26th of July Movement waged a guerrilla war against the Batista government. In the cities and major towns also, resistance groups were organizing until underground groups were everywhere. The strongest was in Santiago formed by [[Frank País]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Cannon | first = Terrance | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1981 | title = Revolutionary Cuba | publisher = Thomas Y. Crowell | location = New York | id = }} </ref><ref> {{cite web | last = Cannon | first = Terrance | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 1981 | month = | url = http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/pais.htm | title = Frank País and the Underground Movement in the cities | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = historyofcuba.com | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-19}}</ref>

In the summer of 1955, País’s organization merged with the 26th of July Movement of Castro. As Castro's movement gained popular support in the cities and countryside, it grew to over eight hundred men. In mid-1957 Castro gave [[Che Guevara]] command of a second column. A [[journalist]], [[Herbert Matthews]] from the ''[[New York Times]]'', came to interview him in the Sierra Maestra, attracting interest to Castro's cause in the United States. The ''New York Times'' front page stories by Matthews presented Castro as a romantic and appealing revolutionary, bearded and dressed in rumpled fatigues.<ref>{{cite web | last = Alter | first = James | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 2006 | month = April | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/21/arts/idbriefs22d.php | title = Review: The Man Who Invented Fidel | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = The International Herald Tribune | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-14}} </ref><ref>{{cite web | last = De Palma | first = Anthony | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/havana/Fidel-1.htm | title = Book Excerpt: The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L.

Castro and Matthews were followed by the TV crew of Andrew Saint George, said to be a [[CIA]] contact person.<ref>{{cite web | last = St George | first = Andrew |date= [[1963-04-12]] | url = http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKstgeorge.htm | title = Biography: Andrew St George|publisher = Spartacus Educational|accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}</ref> Through television, Castro's rudimentary command of the [[English language]] and charismatic presence enabled him to appeal directly to a U.S. audience.

In 1957, Castro also signed the [[Manifesto of the Sierra Maestra]] <ref>http://www.chibas.org/raul_chibas_manifiesto.php </ref> in which he agreed to which was to call elections under the [[Electoral Code of 1943]] within the first 18 months of his time in power and to restore all of the provisions of the [[Constitution of 1940]] that had been suspended under Batista. While he took steps to implement some of the measures in the Manifesto upon coming into power, Cuba failed to have elections, the most important part of the program, within the allotted time.

===Operation Verano===
{{main|Operation Verano}}
[[Image:FidelGuerilla.JPG|thumb|left|Fidel Castro in his days as a guerrilla]]In May 1958, Batista launched ''[[Operation Verano]]'' aiming to crush Castro and other anti-government groups. It was called ''La Ofensiva'' ("The Offensive") by the rebels (Alarcón Ramírez,1997). Although on paper heavily outnumbered, Castro's guerrilla forces scored a series of victories, largely aided by mass desertions from Batista's army of poorly trained and uncommitted young conscripts. During the [[Battle of La Plata]], Castro's forces defeated an entire battalion. While pro-Castro Cuban sources later emphasized the role of Castro's [[guerrilla]] forces in these battles, other groups and leaders were also involved, such as [[escopeteros]] (poorly-armed irregulars). During the ''[[Battle of Las Mercedes]]'', Castro's small army came close to defeat but he managed to pull his troops out by opening up negotiations with General Cantillo while secretly slipping his soldiers out of a trap.

When ''Operation Verano'' ended, Castro ordered three columns commanded by Guevara, Jaime Vega and [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] to invade central Cuba where they were strongly supported by rebellious elements who had long been operating in the area. One of Castro's columns moved out onto the Cauto Plains. Here, they were supported by [[Huber Matos]], [[Raúl Castro]] and others who were operating in the eastern-most part of the province. On the plains, Castro's forces first surrounded the town of Guisa in [[Granma Province]] and drove out their enemies, then proceeded to take most of the towns that had been taken by [[Calixto Garcia]] in the 1895-1898 [[Cuban War of Independence]].

===Battle of Yaguajay===
{{main|Battle of Yaguajay}}
In December 1958, the columns of [[Che Guevara]] and [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] continued their advance through Las Villas province. They succeeded in occupying several towns, and then began preparations for an attack on [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], the provincial capital. Guevara's fighters launched a fierce assault on the Cuban army surrounding Santa Clara, and a vicious house-to-house battle ensued. They also derailed an armored train which Batista had sent to aid his troops in the city while Cienfuegos won the [[Battle of Yaguajay]]. Defeated on all sides, Batista's forces crumbled. The provincial capital was captured after less than a day of fighting on December 31, 1958.

After the loss of Santa Clara and expecting betrayal by his own army, Batista (accompanied by [[president-elect]] [[Carlos Rivero Agüero|Andres Rivero Agüero]]) fled to the [[Dominican Republic]] in the early hours of [[January 1]], [[1959]]. They left behind a junta headed by Gen. [[Eulogio Cantillo]], recently the commander in Oriente province, the center of the Castro revolt. The junta immediately selected Dr. [[Carlos Piedra]], the oldest judge of the [[Supreme Court of Cuba|Supreme Court]], as provisional President of Cuba as specified in the Constitution of 1940. Castro refused to accept the selection of Justice Piedra as provisional President and the Supreme Court refused to administer the oath of office to the Justice.<ref name="How the NYT presented day-one of the Cuban Revolution">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink =| coauthors = |date= | year = 1959 | month = January 2 | url = http://www.cubanow.net/global/loader.php?secc=5&cont=stories/num8/3cHnyt59.htm | title = How the NYT presented day-one of the Cuban Revolution | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = CubaNow.net | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-16}}</ref>

The rebel forces of Fidel Castro moved swiftly to seize power throughout the island.<ref name="How the NYT presented day-one of the Cuban Revolution" /> At the age of 32, Castro had successfully masterminded a classic guerrilla campaign from his headquarters in the Sierra Maestra and ousted Batista.

===Assumption of power===

On [[January 8]], [[1959]], Castro's army rolled victoriously into [[Havana]].<ref name="Castro: The Great Survivor">{{cite web |date= | year = 2000 | month = October | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/244974.stm | title = Castro: The Great Survivor | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = BBC News | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-15}}</ref> As news of the fall of Batista's government spread through Havana, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the scene as one of jubilant crowds pouring into the streets and automobile horns honking. The black and red flag of the 26th of July Movement waved on automobiles and buildings. The atmosphere was chaotic.<ref name="How the NYT presented day-one of the Cuban Revolution" />
Castro called a general strike in protest of the Piedra government. He demanded that Dr. Urrutia, former judge of the Urgency Court of Santiago de Cuba, be installed as the provisional President instead. The Cane Planters Association of Cuba, speaking on behalf of the island's crucial sugar industry, issued a statement of support for Castro and his movement.<ref name="Biological Daily">{{cite web |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.biologydaily.com/biology/Fidel_Castro#Cuban_Missile_Crisis | title = Fidel Castro| format = | work = | pages = | publisher = Biological Daily | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-06}}</ref>

Law [[professor]] [[José Miró Cardona]] created a new government with himself as [[prime minister]] and [[Manuel Urrutia Lleó]] as president on [[January 5]]. The United States officially recognized the new government two days later.<ref>{{cite web |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/chron.html | title = Chronology | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = The National Security Archive | language =|accessdate = 2006-05-19|accessyear = }}</ref> Castro himself arrived in Havana to cheering crowds and assumed the post of [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Armed Forces on [[January 8]].

In February Miró suddenly resigned and on [[February 16]], [[1959]], Castro was sworn in as Prime Minister of Cuba.<ref name="Castro sworn in as Cuban PM" />

Friction with the U.S. developed as the new government began expropriating property owned by major U.S. corporations (United Fruit in particular) and announced plans to base the compensation on the artificially low property valuations that the companies themselves had kept to a fraction of their true value so that their taxes would be negligible.<ref name="Biological Daily" />

During this period Castro repeatedly denied being a communist.<ref>Irving Louis Horowitz and Jaime Suchlicki ''Cuban Communism ''Transaction Publishers, 1998, p. 725.</ref><ref>[http://www.trivia-library.com/c/biography-of-famous-cuban-leader-fidel-castro-part-3.htm David Wallechinsky & Irving Wallace Biography of Famous Cuban Leader Fidel Castro Part 3]</ref><ref>[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cuban-rebels/voices.htm Russell J.

Between [[April 15]] and [[April 26]], Castro and a delegation of industrial and international representatives visited the U.S. as guests of the Press Club. Castro hired one of the best [[public relations]] firms in the United States for a charm offensive visit by Castro and his recently initiated government. Castro answered impertinent questions jokingly and ate hotdogs and hamburgers. His rumpled fatigues and scruffy beard cut a popular figure easily promoted as an authentic hero.<ref>{{cite web | last = Franqui | first = Carlos | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/franqui3.htm | title = Fidel Castro's Trip to the United States | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = historyof Cuba.com | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-16}}</ref> He was refused a meeting with President [[Dwight D.

==Years in power==
On [[May 17]] [[1959]], Castro signed into law the [[First Agrarian Reform Law|First Agrarian Reform]], which limited landholdings to 993 acres (4 km²) per owner and forbade foreign land ownership.<ref>{{cite web | last = Sierra | first = J.A. | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/time/timetbl4.htm | title = Timetable History of Cuba - After The Revolution | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = historyof Cuba.com | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

As early as July 1959, Castro's intelligence chief [[Ramiro Valdés]] contacted the KGB in Mexico City.<ref name="Andrew">{{cite book |last=Andrew |first=Christopher |coauthors=Gordievsky, Oleg |year=1991 |title=Instructions from the Centre: Top Secret Files from the KGB's Foreign Operations |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton General Division |isbn=0-340-56650-7}}</ref> Subsequently, the USSR sent over one hundred mostly Spanish speaking advisors, including [[Enrique Líster|Enrique Líster Forján]], to organize the [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]].

In February 1960, Cuba signed an agreement to buy oil from the USSR. When the U.S.-owned refineries in Cuba refused to process the oil, they were expropriated, and the United States broke off diplomatic relations with the Castro government soon afterward. To the concern of the Eisenhower administration, Cuba began to establish closer ties with the Soviet Union. A variety of pacts were signed between Castro and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]], allowing Cuba to receive large amounts of economic and military aid from the USSR. The mould was set. U.S. disappointment with their lack of power in Cuban decision making fueled Castro's fears leading to increasing Cuban dependence on USSR support.

In June 1960, Eisenhower reduced Cuba's sugar import quota by 7,000,000 tons, and in response, Cuba [[nationalization|nationalized]] some $850 million worth of U.S. property and businesses. The revolutionary government grabbed control of the nation by nationalizing industry, expropriating property owned by Cubans and non-Cubans alike, collectivizing [[agriculture]], and enacting policies which would benefit the population. While popular among the poor, these policies alienated many former supporters of the revolution among the Cuban middle and upper-classes. Over one million Cubans later migrated to the U.S., forming a vocal anti-Castro community in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]], actively supported and funded by successive U.S. administrations. {{see|Cuban-American lobby}}

By the early autumn of 1960, the U.S. government was engaged in a semi-secret campaign to remove Castro from power.<ref>{{cite web |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/chron.html | title = Bay of Pigs Chronology | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = The National Security Archives | language = | accessdate = 2006-11-12}}</ref>

On [[January 3]], [[1961]], President Dwight Eisenhower broke off ties with Cuba, saying that Fidel Castro had provoked him once too often.<ref>{{cite web | last = Sequera | first = Vivian | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 2001 | month = January 5 | url = http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/rcqastr10501.html | title = Raul Castro To U.S.: Normalize Ties | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = Associated Press | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-17}}</ref>

In April 1961, the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempted to depose Castro from power by supporting an armed force of Cuban exiles to retake the island. This attempt is known as the Bay of Pigs invasion.

===Bay of Pigs===
{{main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}
A timeline released by the National Security Archives shows the U.S. began planning to overthrow the government of Cuba in October 1959.<ref>
{{cite web |date= | year = | month = | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/chron.html | title = Bay of Pigs Chronology | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = The National Security Archives | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-18}}</ref> On [[April 17]], [[1961]], approximately 1,400 members of a CIA-trained Cuban exile force landed at the Bay of Pigs, while the U.S. publicly denied any involvement.

Documents released by the National Security Archive show that the CIA expected the Cuban people to welcome a U.S.-sponsored invasion, spontaneously rising up against the Castro regime. It expected Cuban military and police forces to refuse to fight against the CIA's 1,400-man mercenary invasion force.<ref>{{cite web |date= | year = 2001 | month = [[23 March]] | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/press3.html | title = Bay of Pigs documents show CIA expected uprising against Castro, or military support | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = The National Security Archive | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-18

The Cuban armed forces repelled the invaders, killing many and capturing a thousand. On [[May 1]], [[1961]], Castro announced to the hundreds of thousands in the audience that:

{{cquote|The revolution has no time for elections. There is no more democratic government in Latin America than the revolutionary government. ...

In a nationally broadcast speech on [[December 2]], [[1961]], Castro declared that he was a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] and that Cuba was adopting [[Communism]]. On [[February 7]], [[1962]], the U.S. imposed an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo against Cuba]]. This embargo was broadened during 1962 and 1963, including a general travel ban for American tourists.<ref>{{cite web | last = Sierra | first = J.A. | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 1961 | month = [[1 May]] | url = http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/funfacts/embargo.htm | title = Economic Embargo Timeline | work = | pages = | publisher = historyofcuba.com | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-28}}</ref>

Many theories are offered for the failure of the U.S. operation. Some argue that the Americans misjudged Cuban support for Castro.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=313069&sid=ZNS | accessdate = 2006-05-12 | title = ?}} </ref> They had believed the testimonies of the Cuban exiles, who told them that Castro was not well supported by the Cuban people. In the weeks prior to the invasion, the Cuban government had rounded up tens of thousands of Cubans suspected of opposing the government, detaining them in sports stadiums across the island in order to prevent them from joining exile forces. The idea that Cubans would rise up against Castro never materialized. In addition, the covert placement of dozens of Cuban intelligence officials in the invasion force gave the Cuban government detailed information on the operation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Andrew | first = Christopher | coauthors = Vasili Mitrokhin |date=[[2005-09-20]] | title = The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World | publisher = Basic Books}}</ref>

===Cuban Missile Crisis===
{{main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
Tensions between Cuba and the U.S. heightened during the 1962 missile crisis, which nearly brought the US and the USSR into nuclear conflict. Khrushchev conceived the idea of placing missiles in Cuba as a deterrent to a possible U.S. invasion and justified the move in response to US missile deployment in Turkey. After consultations with his military advisors, he met with a Cuban delegation led by Raúl Castro in July in order to work out the specifics. It was agreed to deploy Soviet [[R-12 (missile)|R-12]] [[MRBM]]s on Cuban soil; however, American [[Lockheed U-2]] reconnaissance discovered the construction of the missile installations on [[October 15]], [[1962]] before the weapons had actually been deployed. The US government viewed the installation of Soviet nuclear weapons {{convert|90|mi|km|0}} south of [[Key West]] as an aggressive act and a threat to US security. As a result, the US publicly announced its discovery on [[October 22]], [[1962]], and implemented a [[quarantine]] around Cuba that would actively intercept and search any vessels heading for the island. [[Nikolai Leonov|Nikolai Sergevich Leonov]], who would become a General in the KGB Intelligence Directorate<ref>{{cite paper |author= |date= 1995 -1998 |url= http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/cats/coldwar/xc70-28-.htm |title= The Cold War, television documentary archive |publisher= King's College London, Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives |version= | accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}</ref> and the Soviet KGB deputy station chief in Warsaw, was the translator Castro used for contact with the Russians during this period.

In a personal letter to Khrushchev dated [[October 27]], [[1962]], Castro urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear first strike against the United States if Cuba were invaded, but Khrushchev rejected any first strike response.<ref>{{cite web | last = Khrushchev | first = Nikita Sergeyevich |date= [[1962-10-27]] | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/621030%20Letter%20to%20Castro.pdf | title = Letter to Castro | format = PDF|publisher = The George Washington University|accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}</ref> Soviet field commanders in Cuba were, however, authorized to use [[tactical nuclear weapons]] if attacked by the United States. Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a US commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the US would remove American [[MRBM]]s targeting the [[Soviet Union]] from [[Turkey]] and [[Italy]], a measure that the US implemented a few months later. The missile swap was never publicized because the Kennedy Administration demanded secrecy in order to preserve NATO relations and protect Democratic candidates in the upcoming elections.

===Assassination attempts===
Fabian Escalante, who was long tasked with protecting the life of Castro, has calculated the exact number of assassination schemes and/or attempts by the CIA to be 638. Some such attempts have included an exploding cigar, a fungal-infected scuba-diving suit, and a mafia-style shooting. Some of these plots are depicted in a documentary entitled ''[[638 Ways to Kill Castro]]''.<ref>{{cite web

She subsequently agreed to aid the CIA and attempted to smuggle a jar of [[cold cream]] containing poison pills into his room.

}}</ref> Castro once said in regards to the numerous attempts on his life, "If surviving assassination attempts were an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] event, I would win the gold medal."

According to the [[Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|Family Jewels]] documents declassified by the CIA in 2007, one such assassination attempt before the Bay of Pigs invasion involved [[Johnny Roselli]] and [[Al Capone]]'s successor in the [[Chicago Outfit]], [[Salvatore Giancana]] and his right-hand man [[Santos Trafficante]]. It was personally authorized by then [[US attorney general]] [[Robert Kennedy]] <ref> [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wh2.pdf January 4, 1975 memorandum of conversation] between President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]], made available by the [[National Security Archive]], June 2007 </ref>.

Giancana and Miami Syndicate leader Santos Trafficante were contacted in September 1960 about the possibility of an assassination attempt by a go-between from the CIA, [[Robert Maheu]], after Maheu had contacted Johnny Roselli, a member of the Las Vegas Syndicate and Giancana's number-two man. Maheu had presented himself as a representative of numerous international business firms in Cuba that were being expropriated by Castro. He offered $150,000 for the "removal" of Castro through this operation (the documents suggest that neither Roselli nor Giancana and Trafficante accepted any sort of payments for the job). According to the files, it was Giancana who suggested using a series of poison pills that could be used to doctor Castro's food and drink. These pills were given by the CIA to Giancana's nominee Juan Orta, whom Giancana presented as being an official in the Cuban government who was also in the pay of gambling interests, and who did have access to Castro. After a series of six attempts to introduce the poison into Castro's food, Orta abruptly demanded to be let out of the mission, handing over the job to another, unnamed participant. Later, a second attempt was mounted through Giancana and Trafficante using [[Dr. Anthony Verona]], the leader of the [[Cuban Exile Junta]], who had, according to Trafficante, become "disaffected with the apparent ineffectual progress of the Junta". Verona requested $10,000 in expenses and $1,000 worth of communications equipment. However, it is unknown how far the second attempt went, as the entire program was cancelled shortly thereafter due to the launching of the [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion. <ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070626/us_nm/cia_secrets_dc_4] Holland, Steve and Andy Sullivan. "CIA Tried to get Mafia to kill Castro: documents".

"CIA opens the book on a shady past." MSNBC, June 26, 2007 </ref>

Resulting from these numerous assassination attempts, Castro sent out warnings to the US government to stop the attempts or face retaliatory actions. This resulted in a theory stating that Cuba was behind the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]].

After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Cuba was left bankrupt and isolated by the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Eighty-five percent of its markets had disappeared, along with the subsidies and trade agreements that had supported its economy. The situation became desperate. Daily life was a struggle with extended gas and water outages, severe power shortages, and dwindling food supplies available for rationing.<ref>{{cite web | last = Brandford| first = Becky| authorlink =| coauthors =|date= | year = 2003| month = June 8| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2961320.stm| title = Cuba's hardships fuel discontent| format =| work =| pages =| publisher = BBC News| language =| accessdate = 2006-05-20| accessyear = }}</ref>
By 1994, the island's economy, which had survived over 30 years of sanctions by the US, teetered on the brink of collapse. Cuba was plunged into what was called the "Special Period" during which there were shortages of everything. To survive Cuba legalized the US dollar, turned to tourism, and encouraged the transfer of remittances in US dollars from Cubans living in the USA to their relatives on the Island. Even as late as 2004, Cuba was forced to shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors for the month of October to deal with a crisis caused by fuel shortages.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2004-09-30]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3702784.stm |title=Cuba to shut plants to save power |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2006-05-20}}</ref> However Castro continues to exercise flexibility in coping with these crises.

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Cuba}}
====Soviet Union====
[[Image:Castro Khrushchev.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Fidel Castro embracing former [[Soviet]] Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].]]
Following the establishment of diplomatic ties to the Soviet Union, and after the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuba became increasingly dependent on Soviet markets and military and economic aid. Castro was able to build a formidable military force with the help of Soviet equipment and military advisors. The [[KGB]] kept in close touch with Havana, and Castro tightened Communist Party control over all levels of government, the media, and the educational system, while developing a Soviet-style internal police force.

Castro's alliance with the Soviet Union caused something of a split between him and Guevara. In 1966, Guevara left for [[Bolivia]] in an ill-fated attempt to stir up revolution against the country's government.

On [[August 23]], [[1968]], Castro made a public gesture to the USSR that caused the Soviet leadership to reaffirm their support for him. Two days after the Soviet invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] to repress the [[Prague Spring]], Castro took to the airwaves and publicly denounced the Czech rebellion. Castro warned the Cuban people about the Czechoslovakian 'counterrevolutionaries', who "were moving Czechoslovakia towards capitalism and into the arms of [[imperialism|imperialists]]". He called the leaders of the rebellion "the agents of [[West Germany]] and [[fascist]] reactionary rabble."<ref>{{cite web | last = Castro | first = Fidel | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 1968 | month = August | url = http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/castro/1968/19680824 | title = Castro comments on Czechoslovakia crisis | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = FBIS | language = English | accessdate =}} </ref> In return for his public backing of the invasion, at a time when many Soviet allies were deeming the invasion an infringement of Czechoslovakia's sovereignty, the Soviets bailed out the Cuban economy with extra loans and an immediate increase in oil exports.

In 1971, despite an [[Organization of American States]] convention that no nation in the [[Western Hemisphere]] would have a relationship with Cuba (the only exception being [[Mexico]], which had refused to adopt that convention), Castro took a month-long visit to Chile, following the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with [[Cuba]]. The visit, in which Castro participated actively in the internal politics of the country, holding massive rallies and giving public advice to [[Salvador Allende]], was seen by those on the political right as proof to support their view that "The Chilean Way to Socialism" was an effort to put Chile on the same path as Cuba.<ref>{{cite book | last = Quirk | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 1995 | month = August | url = | title = Fidel Castro | work = | pages = | publisher = W. W. Norton & Company }} </ref>

When Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited Cuba in 1989, the comradely relationship between Havana and Moscow was strained by Gorbachev's implementation of economic and political reforms in the USSR. "We are witnessing sad things in other socialist countries, very sad things," lamented Castro in November 1989, in reference to the changes that were sweeping such communist allies as the Soviet Union, [[East Germany]], [[Hungary]], and [[Poland]].<ref>{{cite web |date=[[1989-11-09]] | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:S17NO9-1592: | title = Castro Laments 'Very Sad Things' in Bloc |publisher = Washington Post |accessdate = 2006-05-22 }}</ref> The subsequent [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 had an immediate and devastating effect on Cuba.

====Other countries====
[[Image:Schafik handal con fidel.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Schafik Handal]], [[Hugo Chávez]], Fidel Castro and [[Evo Morales]], in [[Havana]] in 2004.]]
On [[November 4]], [[1975]], Castro ordered the deployment of Cuban troops to [[Angola]] in order to aid the Marxist [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]]-ruled government against the [[South Africa]]n-backed [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola|UNITA]] opposition forces. Moscow aided the Cuban initiative with the USSR engaging in a massive airlift of Cuban forces into Angola.

Although the relationship between Cuba and Mexico remains strained, each side appears to make attempts to improve it. In 1998, Fidel Castro apologized for remarks he made about Mickey Mouse which led Mexico to recall its ambassador from Havana. He said he intended no offense when he said earlier that Mexican children would find it easier to name Disney characters than to recount key figures in Mexican history. Rather, he said, his words were meant to underscore the cultural dominance of the US.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[1998-12-19]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/238827.stm | title = Castro says sorry to Mexico | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2006-05-21}}</ref> Mexican president [[Vicente Fox]] apologized to Fidel Castro in 2002 over statements by Castro, who had taped their telephone conversation, to the effect that Fox forced him to leave a United Nations summit in Mexico so that he would not be in the presence of President Bush, who also attended.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2002-04-25]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1946089.stm | title = Mexico's Fox apologises to Castro | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2006-05-21}}</ref>

Castro was known to be a friend of former [[Canadian]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] and was an honorary pall bearer at Trudeau's funeral in October 2000. They had continued their friendship after Trudeau left office until his death. [[Canada]] became one of the first [[Americas|American]] allies to openly trade with Cuba. Cuba still has a good relationship with Canada. In 1998, Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] arrived in Cuba to meet President Castro and highlight their close ties.

In December 2001, [[European Union]] representatives described their political dialogue with Cuba as back on track after a weekend of talks in Havana.

==Succession issues==
According to Article 94 of the Cuban Constitution, the First Vice President of the Council of State assumes presidential duties upon the illness or death of the president. At the moment (early 2007), that is [[Raúl Castro]].

Due to the issue of presidential succession and Castro's longevity, there have long been rumors, speculation and hoaxing about Castro's health and demise. In 1998 there were reports that he had a serious brain disease, later discredited.<ref>

Due to his large role in Cuba, his well-being has become a continual source of speculation both on and off the island as he has grown older.

===Rumors of Castro's health===

While Cuba continues to deny U.S.-made claims that Castro is suffering from a terminal cancer, on [[December 24]], [[2006]], Spanish newspaper ''El Periódico de Catalunya'' reported that Spanish surgeon José Luis García Sabrido has been flown to Cuba on a plane charted by the Cuban government. Dr. García Sabrido is an intestinal expert who further specializes in the treatment of cancer. The plane that Dr. García Sabrido's traveled in also was reported to be carrying a large quantity of advanced medical equipment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6208451.stm|publisher=BBC|date=[[25 December]] [[2006]]|title=Surgeon 'flew in to treat Castro'}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/25/world/americas/25cuba.html?ref=americas|publisher=The New York Times|date=[[25 December]] [[2006]]|title=Spanish Doctor is Said to Be Aiding Castro}}</ref> On [[December 26]], [[2006]], shortly after returning to Madrid, Dr. García Sabrido held a news conference in which he answered questions about Castro's health. He stated that "He does not have cancer, he has a problem with his digestive system," and added, "His condition is stable. He is recovering from a very serious operation.

Castro acknowledges that Cuba holds political prisoners, but argues that Cuba is justified because these prisoners are not jailed because of their political beliefs, but have been convicted of "counter-revolutionary" crimes, including bombings. Castro portrays [[Opposition to Fidel Castro|opposition to the Cuban government]] as illegitimate, and the result of an ongoing conspiracy fostered by Cuban exiles with ties to the United States or the CIA. .<ref>PBS.

==Religious beliefs==
Castro was raised a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] as a child but does not practice as one. In [[Oliver Stone]]'s documentary ''[[Comandante]]'', Castro states "I have never been a believer", and has total conviction that there is only one life.<ref>{{YouTube|WLUcOqeoKck|Comandante - Fidel Castro & Oliver Stone}}</ref> [[Pope John XXIII]] [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] Castro in 1962 on the basis of a 1949 decree by [[Pope Pius XII]] forbidding Catholics from supporting communist governments. The excommunication was aimed at undermining support for Castro among Catholics.

In 1992, Castro agreed to loosen restrictions on religion and even permitted church-going Catholics to join the Cuban Communist Party. He began describing his country as "secular" rather than "atheist".<ref> {{cite web | author= | title= Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba | journal= The New York Times -on the Web | year= | volume= | issue= | pages= | url= http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/cuba-pope-index.html}} </ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Cuba in 1998, the first visit by a reigning pontiff to the island. Castro and the Pope appeared side by side in public on several occasions during the visit. Castro wore a dark blue business suit (in contrast to his fatigues) in his public meetings with the Pope and treated him with reverence and respect.<ref name="Pope Condemns Embargo">{{cite web | first= Larry | last= Rother | authorlink= | coauthors= | year= January 28, 1998 | title= Pope Condemns Embargo; Castro Attends Mass | edition= | publisher= The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/012698pope-cuba-rdp.html | id= }}</ref>
With Castro and other senior Cuban officials in the front row at a mid-morning Mass, the pope delivered a ringing call for pluralism in Cuba. He rejected the materialistic, one-party ideology of the Cuban state. And he said that true liberation "cannot be reduced to its social and political aspects," but must also include "the exercise of freedom of conscience&nbsp;&mdash; the basis and foundation of all other human rights." Later in the day, though, the pope also made his most critical reference yet to the American economic embargo of Cuba. At a departure ceremony at [[José Martí International Airport]] that evening, he said that Cuba's "material and moral poverty" arises not only from "limitations to fundamental freedoms" and "discouragement of the individual," but also from "restrictive economic measures&nbsp;&mdash; unjust and ethically unacceptable&nbsp;&mdash; imposed from outside the country."<ref name="Pope Condemns Embargo" /> He also criticized widespread [[abortion]]<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = |date= January 1, 1998 | url = http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9801/22/pope/ | title = Pope attacks Cuban abortion policy|publisher = CNN.com|accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}</ref> in Cuban hospitals and urged Castro to end the government's monopoly on education to allow the return of Catholic schools. A month later Castro condemned the use of abortion as a form of [[birth control]].<ref>{{cite web |date= | year = 1998 | month = February 28 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/59998.stm | title = Castro condemns abortion | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = BBC News | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-20}}</ref>

In December 1998, Castro formally re-instated [[Christmas Day]] as the official celebration it was formerly before the Communist Party abolished it in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |date= | year = 1998 | month = December 5 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/228764.stm | title = Castro ratifies Christmas holiday | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = BBC News | language =|accessdate = 2006-05-20|accessyear = }}</ref> Cubans were again allowed to mark [[Christmas]] as a holiday and to openly hold religious processions. The Pope sent a telegram to Castro thanking him for restoring Christmas as a public holiday.<ref>{{cite web |date= | year = 1998 | month = December 28 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/243705.stm | title = Pope's Christmas message for Castro | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = BBC News | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-20}}</ref>

Castro attended a Roman Catholic convent blessing in 2003. The purpose of this unprecedented event was to help bless the newly restored convent in Old Havana and to mark the fifth anniversary of the Pope's visit to Cuba.<ref>{{cite web |date= | year = 2003 | month = March 9 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2833699.stm | title = Castro attends convent blessing | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = BBC News | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-20}}</ref>

The senior spiritual leader of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] faith arrived in Cuba in 2004, the first time any Orthodox Patriarch has visited Latin America in the Church's history. [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I]] consecrated a cathedral in Havana and bestowed an honor on Fidel Castro. His aides said that he was responding to the decision of the Cuban Government to build and donate to the Orthodox Christians a tiny Orthodox cathedral in the heart of old Havana.<ref>{{cite web | last = Gibbs | first = Stephen | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 2004 | month = January 22 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3418733.stm | title = Castro greets Orthodox patriarch | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = BBC News | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-20}}</ref>

After [[Pope John Paul II]]'s death in April 2005, an emotional Castro attended a [[funeral mass|mass]] in his honor in Havana's cathedral and signed the Pope's condolence book at the Vatican Embassy.<ref>{{cite web | last = Newman | first = Lucia |date=April 6, 2005 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/americas/04/04/pope.castro/ | title = Castro signs pope's condolence book | publisher = CNN.com }}</ref>
He had last visited the cathedral in 1959, 46 years earlier, for the wedding of one of his sisters. Cardinal [[Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino]] led the mass and welcomed Castro, who was dressed in a black suit, expressing his gratitude for the "heartfelt way the death of our Holy Father John Paul II was received (in Cuba)."<ref>{{cite web | last = Batista|first = Carlos|date= [[2005-04-05]] | url = http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2005/04/05/mourns.shtml | title = Fidel Castro mourns pope at Havana cathedral | publisher = Caribbean Net News | accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}</ref>

==Public image==
By wearing military-style uniforms and leading mass demonstrations, Castro projects an image of a perpetual revolutionary. He is mostly seen in military attire, but his personal tailor, Merel [[Van 't Wout]], convinced him to occasionally change to a business suit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://secure-wildcat.arizona.edu//papers/old-wildcats/spring95/February/February10,1995/01_5_m.html |title=In brief |accessdate=2006-08-12 |accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[1995-02-10]] |publisher=Arizona Daily Wildcat}}</ref> Castro is often referred to as "Comandante", but is also nicknamed "''El Caballo''", meaning "The Horse", a label that was first attributed to Cuban entertainer [[Benny Moré]], who on hearing Castro passing in the Havana night with his entourage, shouted out "Here comes the horse!"<ref>Richard Gott, ''Cuba : A new history''. p. 175. Yale press.</ref> During the revolutionary campaign, fellow rebels knew Castro as "The Giant".<ref>Jon Lee Anderson. Che Guevara : A revolutionary life. p. 317.</ref> Large throngs of people gather to cheer at Castro's fiery speeches, which typically last for hours. Many details of Castro's private life, particularly involving his family members, are scarce and Castro insists that he does not promote a [[cult of personality]]. When asked about the matter in 1985 he replied,

{{bquote|Although we have been dogmatic, we have never preached cult of personality. You will not see a statue of me anywhere, nor a school with my name, nor a street, nor a little town, nor any type of personality cult because we have not taught our people to believe, but to think, to reason out."<ref>"[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/latin_america/cuba/castro_2-12-85.html Fidel Castro]" ''PBS Online Newshour'' February 12, 1985.</ref>}}

There are no streets in Cuba named after Castro, and no statues or peso bills bearing his image; however billboards with his picture are very common in the island.<ref>[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/fidel/castro-family.htm Castro's Family] Miami Herald October 8, 2000</ref> Despite this, Castro was accused by American [[anarchist]] [[Sam Dolgoff]] of "bask[ing] in the adulation and servility of his subordinates" and "creating a regime built around the cult of the personality functions" encouraging "the illusion that only he and his select group of revolutionaries have earned the right to wield unlimited power over the people of Cuba."<ref>[[Sam Dolgoff]]. ''[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/dolgoff/cubanrevolution/chapter9.html The Cuban Revolution: A Critical Perspective]''.</ref> Castro has also been described as an example of the rise of a distinct "[[Charismatic authority|charismatic leader]]"<ref> [http://web.pdx.edu/~tothm/essays/essays/toward_a_theory_of__the_routiniz.htm Towards a theory of the routinization of Charisma] </ref> common to developing nations, and of encouraging the "personalistic political regime". This theory contends that Castro has maintained power largely through highly visible, charismatic leadership and popular appeals to the Cuban people, though the administration is successful only as long as the leader's charisma lasts.<ref>Erin Bream, ''[http://www.leadershipreview.org/2004fall/article2_fall_2004.asp Personalistic Political Leadership in Castro's Cuba]''.</ref>

By his first wife [[Mirta Diaz-Balart|Mirta Díaz-Balart]], Castro has a son named Fidel "Fidelito" Castro Díaz-Balart. Díaz-Balart and Castro were divorced in 1955, and she remarried. After a spell in [[Madrid]], Díaz-Balart reportedly returned to Havana to live with Fidelito and his family.<ref>Ann Louise Bardach : ''Cuba Confidential''. p. 67. "One knowledgable source claims that Mirta returned to Cuba in early 2002 and is now living with Fidelito and his family."</ref> Fidelito grew up in [[Cuba]]; for a time, he ran Cuba's atomic-energy commission before being removed from the post by his father.<ref name="anderson">Jon Lee Anderson, "Castro's Last Battle: Can the revolution outlive its leader?" The New Yorker, 31 July, 2006. 51.</ref> Díaz-Balart's nephews are Republican U.S. Congressmen [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]] and [[Mario Diaz-Balart]], vocal critics of the Castro government.

Fidel has five other sons by his second wife, Dalia Soto del Valle: Alexis, Alexander, Alejandro, Antonio, and Angel.<ref name="anderson"/>

While Fidel was married to Mirta, he had an affair with Naty Revuelta resulting in a daughter named [[Alina Fernández|Alina Fernández-Revuelta]].<ref name="anderson"/> Alina left Cuba in 1993, disguised as a Spanish tourist, and sought asylum in the United States. She has been a vocal critic of her father's policies.

His sister [[Juanita Castro]] has been living in the United States since the early 1960s and was featured in a film documentary by [[Andy Warhol]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web |date= | year = 1965 | month = | url = http://imdb.com/title/tt0249717/ | title = The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) - The Life of Juanita Castro | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = | accessdate = 2006-08-05}}</ref>

===Wealth===
In 2005, American business and financial magazine ''[[Forbes]]'' listed Castro among the world's richest people, with an estimated net worth of $550 million. The estimates, which the magazine admitted was "more art than science",<ref name="CBS wealth"> [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/16/world/main1622957.shtml Castro: I Am Not Rich.] CBS News. Assessed 24 April 2007.</ref> claimed that the Cuban leader's personal wealth was nearly double that of Britain's Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], despite anecdotal evidence from diplomats and businessmen that the Cuban leader's personal life was notable for its austerity.<ref name="BBC wealth">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4985510.stm Castro denies huge fortune claim]. BBC News.</ref> This assessment was drawn by making economic estimates of the net worth of Cuba's [[state-owned company|state-owned companies]], and used the assumption that Castro had personal economic control.<ref name="wealth"> http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12807201/ Castro blasts Forbes over wealth report. Associated Press. Accessed December 13. 2006</ref> Forbes magazine later increased the estimates to $900 million, adding rumors of large cash stashes in Switzerland.<ref name="BBC wealth"/> The magazine offered no proof of this information,<ref name="CBS wealth"/> and according to CBS news, Castro's entry on the rich list was notably brief compared to the amount of information provided on other figures.<ref name="CBS wealth"/>

Castro, who had considered suing the magazine, responded that the claims were "lies and slander", and that they were part of a US campaign to discredit him.<ref name="BBC wealth"/> He declared: "If they can prove that I have a bank account abroad, with $900m, with $1m, $500,000, $100,000 or $1 in it, I will resign."<ref name="BBC wealth"/> President of Cuba's Central Bank, Francisco Soberon, called the claims a "grotesque slander", asserting that money made from various state owned companies is pumped back into the island's economy, "in sectors including health, education, science, internal security, national defense and solidarity projects with other countries."<ref name="wealth"/>

Maria Werla, a [[Cuban-American]] anti-Castro activist, claims, partially based on the testimonials of defectors who were close to Castro, that Castro and his loyalists control several billions of dollars in real estate, bank accounts, private estates, yachts and other assets — called “the Comandante's Reserves” — in Europe, Latin America and Asia - and a luxurious lifestyle for the top Cuban leadership.<ref>{{cite paper |author= Werlau, Maria C. |date= 2005 |url= http://info.lanic.utexas.edu/project/asce/pdfs/volume15/pdfs/werlau.pdf |title=Fidel Castro, Inc.: A Global Conglomerate| format = PDF |publisher= Cuba in Transition |version= |accessdate= 2006-05-28 }} </ref>
